## Introducing Laundry Blues
<i><a href="https://laundryblues.herokuapp.com/">Laundry Blues</a></i> is a Streamlit web application that I have built myself for a University group project in a Data Mining course.
This web application revolves around deploying certain interesting insights for a specific dataset regarding customer profiling of a laundromat.
